<h2>Understanding Supply Lines</h2>
Each planet has a supply line connecting it to a planet, whether it is Earth or a neighboring planet. These are also routes into different sectors of the galactic frontier.

When configuring a planet to receive a supply line, the planet uses a `Beam` object with two `Attachment` objects. The table below will assist in referencing where each `Attachment` goes.

| Property     | Value Type |
|:---------------|:-----------|
| Attachment0 | Destination |
| Attachment1 | Source |
